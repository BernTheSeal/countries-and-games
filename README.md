## Flag Match
In the Flag Match, players are presented with four random flags and the name of a country. The objective is to match the correct flag with the corresponding country. Players can test their knowledge of world flags by making the right choices within a time limit.

## Population Showdown
The Population Showdown game mode challenges players to estimate the population of two randomly selected countries. One country's population is provided, while the other remains unknown. Players must decide whether the population of the second country is higher or lower than the given value. The game continues as players make correct predictions, testing their awareness of global demographics.
